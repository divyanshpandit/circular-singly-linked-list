This repository contains a Python implementation of a Circular Singly Linked List (CSLL). A circular singly linked list is a data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. This implementation includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and iteration through the list.
